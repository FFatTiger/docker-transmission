# Transmission Docker Build with Long Filename Fix

A Docker implementation of the long filename fix for Transmission, based on the solution provided by [@chrdev](https://github.com/chrdev) in [transmission/transmission#122](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/issues/122#issuecomment-2401583834).

## Build Instructions

1. Initialize and update submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t transmission .
```

## Alternative: Pull Pre-Built Image

Alternatively, you can pull the pre-built Docker image I have created with the long filename fix from Docker Hub:
